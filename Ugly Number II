Ugly Number II

An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.

Given an integer n, return the nth ugly number..

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 10
Output: 12
Explanation: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12] is the sequence of the first 10 ugly numbers.
Example 2:

Input: n = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.



Solution:-

class Solution(object):
    def nthUglyNumber(self, n):
        primes = [2,3,5]
        uglyHeap = [1]
        visited = set()
        visited.add(1)
        for _ in range(n):
            curr = heappop(uglyHeap)
            for prime in primes:
                new_ugly = curr * prime
                if new_ugly not in visited:
                    heappush(uglyHeap, new_ugly)
                    visited.add(new_ugly)
        return curr
